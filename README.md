## 📚 Algorithm Details

### ⏳ FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve):
- **Type**: Non-preemptive scheduling  
- **Mechanism**: Strict FIFO queue processing  
- **Key Traits**:
  - Simple implementation
  - Demonstrates convoy effect
  - No starvation
- **Visualization**: Sequential process blocks

### 🔍 SJF (Shortest Job First):
- **Variants**:
  - Non-preemptive (SJF)
  - Preemptive (SRTF - Shortest Remaining Time First)
- **Mechanism**: Priority queue sorted by burst time  
- **Key Traits**:
  - Optimal for minimum wait time
  - Shows starvation potential
  - Requires burst time prediction
- **Visualization**: Preemption alerts, burst time tooltips

### 🔄 Round Robin:
- **Core**: Time-slicing with quantum  
- **Mechanism**: Circular queue with preemption  
- **Key Traits**:
  - Configurable time quantum
  - Fair CPU allocation
  - High context switches
- **Visualization**: 
  - Quantum boundaries marked
  - Context switch counter

### ⚖️ Priority Scheduling:
- **Variants**:
  - Static vs dynamic priorities
  - Preemptive/non-preemptive
- **Mechanism**: Priority queue execution  
- **Key Traits**:
  - Critical for real-time systems
  - Shows priority inversion
  - Requires aging mechanism
- **Visualization**:
  - Priority color-coding
  - Starvation warnings

## 📊 CPU Scheduling Algorithms Comparison

| Algorithm          | Type       | Decision Mode | Preemptive? | Starvation? | Avg. Wait Time | Key Use Case                     |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **FCFS**           | Non-preemptive | Arrival Time   | ❌ No       | ❌ No       | High           | Batch systems                    |
| **SJF**            | Both       | Burst Time     | ✅ (SRTF)   | ✅ Possible | Lowest         | Interactive systems              |
| **Round Robin**    | Preemptive | Time Quantum   | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No       | Medium         | Time-sharing systems             |
| **Priority**       | Both       | Priority       | Optional    | ✅ Possible | Varies         | Real-time systems                |

### Key Characteristics:
1. **FCFS** (First-Come-First-Serve):
   - Simple but suffers from convoy effect
   - Example: `P1(24ms) → P2(3ms) → P3(3ms)` has avg wait time=17ms

2. **SJF** (Shortest Job First):
   - Optimal for minimum wait time but needs future knowledge
   - Preemptive version = SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)

3. **Round Robin**:
   - Each process gets CPU for fixed time quantum (e.g., 4ms)
   - Performance depends heavily on quantum size

4. **Priority**:
   - Can be preemptive or non-preemptive
   - Requires aging to prevent starvation

### 📝 When to Use:
- **FCFS**: When simplicity > performance
- **SJF/SRTF**: When burst times are predictable
- **Round Robin**: Fairness required (OS time-sharing)
- **Priority**: Urgent tasks need precedence

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues
- **Missing DLLs**: Install [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- **DPI Scaling**: Add manifest file for proper high-DPI display scaling
- **Admin Privileges**: Right-click → "Run as administrator" if getting access errors

### macOS Issues
- **Permission Errors**: Grant Terminal "Full Disk Access" in System Preferences → Security & Privacy
- **Apple Silicon**: Use `arch -x86_64 python3 main.py` for Rosetta 2 compatibility
- **Dark Mode**: Ensure `NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance` is not set in Info.plist

### Linux Issues
- **Missing Packages**: Install `python3-tk` for GUI components
- **Wayland Support**: Run with `GDK_BACKEND=x11` if experiencing graphical glitches
- **Systemd Integration**: Use `--user` flag for non-root process monitoring

### Cross-Platform Issues
- **Virtual Environment**: Always activate with `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `.\venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- **Dependencies**: Use `pip install --prefer-binary` to avoid compilation issues
- **Firewall**: Add Python to allowed apps if connection-related errors occur
